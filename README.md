# SpreadSheet Visualizer


"The Data API project provides an API for data processing. It allows users to upload Excel files, extract data from the files, perform data transformations, and retrieve processed data. The API accepts Excel files, reads the data using the 'xlsx' library, processes the data to generate useful insights, and returns the processed data in a structured format. The project utilizes Express.js for the server-side implementation, Multer for file uploading, and Swagger for API documentation. It aims to simplify the process of data analysis and provide a user-friendly interface for data processing tasks.
